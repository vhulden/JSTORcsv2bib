The Communist Party's view of the woman question was shaped by the advice of the USSR and the Communist International, as well as by the party's social base and the political understanding of its own membership. The Communist Party's Women's Department helped to create a new national organization for women, the Women's Labor Leagues, which, led by Florence Custance, experienced substantial growth in the 1920s. The Communist Party gave more attention to women's inequality than had previous socialist parties, although it failed to live up to its stated aims to organize working-class women and encourage women's participation in the revolutionary movement. /// Cet article analyse la position du Parti communiste du Canada sur la question des femmes, le rôle des femmes à l'intérieur du parti, ainsi que les succès et les échecs du parti dans ses tentatives d'organisation des femmes de la classe ouvrière. L'attitude du PCC sur la question des femmes était influencée par le PCURSS et par la Troisième Internationale ainsi que par la base sociale du parti et la compréhension politique de ses membres. La section des femmes du PCC contribua à créer une organisation nationale pour les femmes, La Ligue des femmes ouvrières, qui, sous la direction de Florence Custance, connut une croissance substantielle pendant les années 1920. Quoiqu'il ne réalisa pas ses objectifs d'organiser les femmes de la classe ouvrière et d'encourager la participation des femmes dans le mouvement révolutionnaire, le PCC accorda quand m̂eme plus d'attention à l'inégalité des femmes que les autres partis socialistes.

Triece	Rhetoric Society Quarterly	33	2	2003-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 5-24	Taylor & Francis, Ltd.	fla		This article examines the rhetoric of labor activist Leonora O'Reilly for the ways she reconstituted her audience through a second persona of "intelligent workers." By balancing concrete contextualization with abstract visions of a future democracy, O'Reilly established identification with her audience of young, uneducated, poor women while simultaneously encouraging them to become a group of outspoken agents capable of transforming their oppressive circumstances. This article also explores the ways firsthand experiences influenced the process of reconstitution. To recognize the influences of extra-verbal phenomena does not downplay rhetoric's role in the creation of an audience but rather calls attention to the dialectical relationship between language and an extradiscursive reality and encourages scholars to examine a number of factors which can precipitate, impede, or otherwise shape the process of reconstitution.

Publishers are very much influenced by currents in their societies. Such factors as levels of literacy, habits of book purchasing, libraries, copyright regulations and bookstores have an impact on the nature of publishing and the book industry. The educational system, a particularly important consumer of books, is crucial to publishing. In industrialized nations, where levels of literacy are high, it is likely that publishing will be highly developed although it is under increasing attack from such forces as television and other mass media. In the Third World, the mass media are not highly developed, and books often have a particularly important role. This article argues that it is impossible to ignore the broader elements of the modern intellectual community in discussing publishing, and that books continue to play a key role in the development of that community and of the culture in general.

In this article, we trace the fine, if at times fraught, history of sociology at WU, from 1906 to 1989. The department has been home to two presidents of the ASA and location for exciting work in both theory and research. We note that the demise of the department has been a long time in the making, although the death blow was struck as if it constituted the necessary slaughter of the weak. A conservative university has eliminated a once-stellar department and, in so doing, dismissed the relevance of social thought in this modern era.

This essay discusses the feminist dilemma of whether to support gay marriage to promote these individual civil rights or whether to critique marriage as a part of the patriarchal system that oppresses women.

This study uses interviews with prostitutes' clients to show how commodity exchange can be understood as being morally superior to gift exchange. The interviewees praise "market exchange" of sex for lacking the ambiguity, status-dependence, and potential hypocrisy that they see in the "gift exchange" of sex characteristic of romantic relationships. This justification of market exchange suggests that theories of the "moral economy" that posit a dichotomy between "premarket" and "market" societies understate the degree to which market societies are, for their participants, also moral economies: they are economies embodying moral beliefs about individual autonomy, democratic equality, and unambiguous and nondiscretionary fulfillment of obligations. Critics of the market do themselves a disservice in ignoring the powerful moral appeals of market exchange. More generally, sociological analyses that pit "norms" against "self-interest" ignore the ways in which norms can enable as well as constrain self-interested market behavior. /// [Spanish] La prostitución como práctica cultural traza la línea entre lo que se tiene que dar como un regalo y lo que se tiene que dar a cambio como producto; por lo que una investigación de la prostitución puede ser una ulterior comprención del apuntalamiento ideológico del intercambio de producto. Este trabajo se basa en entrevistas con clientes de prostitutas para demostrar cómo el cambio de producto puede ser entendido como moralmente superior que el cambio del regalo. Los entrevistados elogian "el mercado de cambio" de sexo por carecer de ambiguedad, dependencia de estatus, e hipocrecía potencial que ellos ven el el "intercambio de regalo" de las características de sexo de las relaciones románticas. Esta justificación del cambio de mercado sugiere que las teorías de la "economía moral" postulan una dicotomía entre el "pre-mercado" de sociedades y el "mercado" de sociedades que subestima el grado del cual el mercado de sociedades son, para sus participantes, también las economías morales: son economías que materializan creencias morales acerca de la autonomía moral, igualdad democrática y una satisfacción de obligaciones sin ambiguedad y sin discriminación. Críticos del mercado se perjudican ellos mismos al ignorar los fuertes Ilamamientos morales del mercado de cambio. Generalmente, el análisis sociológico que se opone a las "normas" en contra del "auto-interés" ignora las formas en las cuales las normas pueden habilitar, así como también reprimir un comportamiento autointeresado de mercado. /// [Chinese] (Unicode for Chinese abstract). /// [Japanese] (Unicode for Japanese abstract).

Ferguson	Signs	36	3	2011-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 733-757	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Abstract Several feminist commentaries on Emma Goldman have focused critical attention on tensions between her anarchist feminist demands for freedom in personal relations and her longing for a stable and fulfilling relationship with a man. This article turns those inquiries around, asking why feminist readings of Goldman have featured those questions. I suggest that Goldman’s implicit practices of rhetoric and genre, as much as her explicit ideology and gendered social relations, encourage critics to look for consistency between her political theory and her personal life. I look at Goldman’s habits of genre as shaped both by the chronological practices of film media versus theater and by the discursive practices of modernism versus those of romanticism and realism. My goal is to open up a field of questioning in which consistency between her ideological commitments and her love life takes a backseat to inquiry into how she made meaning in politics and in love.

After a brief theoretical overview that includes Marxist theories of class, theories of racial inequality, and feminist Marxism, I turn to an historical account of proletarianization in the United States between 1860 and 1920. In concluding, I analyze the division of labor and the development of class consciousness in the United States by taking into account the legal and social restrictions that enforced racialized and gendered conceptions of citizenship.

Deux thèses sont défendues: ce mouvement a des retombées matérielles et ses politiques identitaires ne mènent pas à son extinction.

The paper deals with the Board's relationship to the motion picture industry and its efforts to avoid a formal structure of centralized film censorship. The establishment of official censorship boards in several states and the industry's formation of the MPPDA in 1922 ultimately undercut the National Board's authority by 1922.

That claim, if true, could be hard to substantiate. For most terrorism is not publicly recognized as such, and it is far commoner than paradigms of the usual suspects suggest. Everday lives under oppressive regimes, in racist environments, and of women, children, and elders everywhere who suffer violence in their homes offer instances of terrorisms that seldom capture public attention. Or so this essay argues, through exploring two models of terrorism and the points of view highlighted by each.

Demographic data show that rates of non-marriage have increased significantly across racial-ethnic groups. Among women, African Americans have the highest rates of non-marriage, followed by Asian Americans, and lastly, by European Americans. This research explores what it means for increasing numbers of Chinese American women to be delaying or rejecting marriage. Given the predominance of traditional gender expectations in Chinese and Chinese American cultures, how do never married Chinese American women understand their marital status? How does being never married affect or modify their Asian American identities?

Kimmel	Gender and Society	1	3	1987-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 261-283	Sage Publications, Inc.	fla		This article examines the variety of men's responses to feminism in late nineteenth-and early twentieth-century United States through texts that addressed the claims raised by the turn-of-the-century women's movements. Antifeminist texts relied on traditional arguments, as well as Social Darwinist and natural law notions, to reassert the patriarchal family and to oppose women's suffrage and participation in the public sphere. Masculinist texts sought to combat the purported feminization of American manhood by proposing islands of masculinity, untainted by feminizing forces; proscribed homosociality was also cast as an effective antidote to homosexuality. Profeminist texts openly embraced women's claims for changes in public participation and private and family life, both out of a sense of justice and the conviction that such changes would benefit men and challenge the emerging industrial capitalist order. Parallels to contemporary men's responses to the women's movement are suggested.

The school was influenced by Leo Tolstoy's school at Yasnaya Polyana in Russia and Francisco Ferrer's Escuela Moderna in Barcelona. The Escuela Moderna served as the model for a pedagogy committed to the direct teaching of revolutionary politics while Tolstoy's school at Yasnaya Polyana served as the model for a pedagogy committed to a rebel culture that fostered individual creativity and imagination. Historically it had been difficult to reconcile these two strands of radical education. A history of the New York years of the Modern School (1911-1915) offers an understanding of the interaction between a pedagogy concerned with rebel culture and a pedagogy committed to revolutionary politics. This interaction was positive when the libertarian classroom experiences emphasizing freedom, creativity and imagination were given political direction by the adult movement housed in the same building. The adult center provided the possibility for interchange between movement speakers, artists and organizers like Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman and the daily play of the children. However, when the political activities of the adult movement adversely affected the children's school and forced the school to move to the country a growing separation developed between movement politics and the children's activities. This separation was exacerbated by the shifting political and historical climate of the times forcing the separation of rebel culture from revolutionary politics. By 1920 rebel culture emerged as the dominant pedagogical model. The Modern School became more like the other experimental schools that flourished during the Progressive Era and revolutionary politics would only surface periodically in the next thirty years of the school's existence at Stelton, New Jersey.

Bercuson	Labour / Le Travail	7		1981-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 95-112	Athabasca University Press, Canadian Committee on Labour History	fla		This is an analysis of the concept of working-class culture as applied by some practitioners of the new labour history in Canada. The article begins with a comparison of the approach of traditional labour history to that of the "new" labour history and asserts that there are significant differences in philosophy and lesser differences in methodology. A brief examination of the concept of working-class culture and how it is to be utilized by historians follows. The validity of using such a general framework is questioned in a close examination of recent major works of the new labour history genre. A conclusion is offered that these works show that the application of general principles is a tricky business because, although factual evidence appears at times to support the idea that working-class culture was an important determinant, at other times it does not. The article concludes by questioning the assumption that there is any "best" way of approaching the study of social history; that to assert that history must be studied "from the bottom up" is as predeterministic as the notion that it should be studied "from the top down." Prejudice and a priori assumption plagues all historians. /// L'auteur se propose d'étudier le concept de culture ouvrière tel qu'il est employé par un certain nombre de spécialistes en histoire ouvrière au Canada. L'article débute par une comparaison entre l'approche traditionnelle en histoire ouvrière et celle pratiquée par la "nouvelle" vague d'historiens des travailleurs et conclue qu'il y a des différences idéologiques, mais pas tellement de différences méthodologiques entre les deux. Suit une brève analyse du concept de culture ouvrière employé par ces historiens. L'auteur met en cause la validité de ce concept après avoir sérieusement étudié leur principaux travaux récents. En conclusion, il affirme que ces travaux démontrent que l'application de principes généraux est trompeuse puisque, quoique les faits appuient parfois l'idée que la culture ouvrière fut d'une importance déterminante, à d'autres moments, ces faits le contredisent. L'article se termine en remettant en cause l'affirmation qu'il y a une meilleure façon d'aborder l'histoire sociale et que l'histoire doit être étudiée de la "base vers le sommet." Tous les historiens sont sujets aux préjugés et aux affirmations a priori.

With specific reference to Hollywood          movies about historical subjects, the author identifies five questions that are likely to engage historians: (1) Should historians focus on blockbusters or experimental films? (2) Are movies about the past          essentially about the present? (3) How can scholarship move beyond a political history of movies? (4) In which directions can research on Hollywood films move to achieve deeper levels of understanding?          (5) Is "cinematic history" essentially a genre?

It argues that the issue of nation and impersonation, sexuality and political representation, constitutes a peculiar subject for modern Chinese writers, and that among these contests for leadership positions, traditional theatre and its transvestite dramaturgy are continuously called on, as true or false impersonations of China in the theatre of the world. The cases-in-point are two works about female impersonation, one by Ba Jin (b. 1904), champion of May Fourth literature, and the other by Qin Shouou (1908-1994), a popular middle-brow fiction writer in the Republican era.

The resulting interactive electronic multimedia network not only depends upon viewer response, but often requires participants to be electronically disguised in order to be recognized in virtual systems. The potential of these new media has empowered individuals to not only make intimate contact with technology, but to participate meaningfully in the ensuing dialogue.

Although much has recently been written on Francoist camps, very little research has been undertaken on their Republican counterparts. As a consequence the significance of Republican camps has not been recognised. Although some historians argue that the Republicans used forced labour only in a desperate attempt to avoid military defeat, this article demonstrates that labour camps were an integral aspect of Republican ' popular justice'. Work, it was argued, would redeem fascists' by allowing them to contribute to the economic reconstruction and transformation of Spain. /// Cet article analyse l'utilisation du travail forcé dans l'Espagne républicaine durant la Guerre Civile. Tandis qu'on a récemment beaucoup écrit sur les camps franquistes, peu de recherches ont été effectuées du côté républicain. Ainsi, l'importance des camps républicains n'a pas été reconnue. Même si certains historiens défendent la thèse que les Républicains n'ont eu recours au travail forcé que dans un effort désespéré pour éviter la défaite militaire, cet article démontre que les camps de travail faisaient partie intégrante de la ' justice populaire' républicaine. Ils soutenaient que le travail permettait aux ' fascistes' de se racheter par leur contribution à la reconstruction économique et à la transformation de l'Espagne. /// Dieser Artikel erforscht die Anwendung der Zwangsarbeit im republikanischen Spanien während des Bürgerkrieges. Obwohl in letzter Zeit viel über die Arbeitslager Francos geschrieben wurde, sind ihre republikanischen Pendants kaum erforscht. Folglich ist die Bedeutung der republikanischen Lager nicht anerkannt worden. Auch wenn gewisse Historiker argumentieren, dass die Republikaner nur auf die Zwangsarbeit zurückgriffen, um in einem letzten verzweifelten Versuch die militärische Niederlage abzuwenden, zeigt dieser Artikel auf, dass die Arbeitslager ein integraler Bestandteil der republikanischen 'Volksjustiz' waren. Sie vertraten die Meinung, dass die Arbeit die 'Faschisten' erlösen würde indem es ihnen erlaube zum wirtschaftlichen Wiederaufbau und der Verwandlung Spaniens beizutragen.

Gutmann	Annual Review of Anthropology	26		1997-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 385-409	Annual Reviews	fla		Anthropology has always involved men talking to men about men, yet until fairly recently very few within the discipline had truly examined men as men. This chapter explores how anthropologists understand, utilize, and debate the category of masculinity by reviewing recent examinations of men as engendered and engendering subjects. Beginning with descriptions of four distinct ways in which masculinity is defined and treated in anthropology, special attention is paid to the relations of difference, inequality, and women to the anthropological study of masculinities, including the awkward avoidance of feminist theory on the part of many anthropologists who study manhood. Specific topics discussed include the diverse cultural economies of masculinity, the notion of cultural regions in relation to images of manhood, male friendship, machismo, masculine embodiment, violence, power, and sexual faultlines.

For "terrorism" is not an agent. Nor is it clear what relationship to terrorism agents must have in order to be legitimate targets. Nor is it clear what kinds of terrorism count. Would a war on terrorism in the home be a justifiable response to domestic battering? If not, do similar objections apply to a war on public terrorism?

The Puerto Rican people overwhelmingly ratified prohibition in a referendum in July 1917. Prohibition won because it was emotionally linked to patriotism and morality. Prohibition enforcement was almost impossible, compounded by the colonial status of the island. It was that status which brought an immediate end to prohibition in Puerto Rico with the demise of prohibition in the United States in 1933.

I approach the topic of gender relations from a previously neglected perspective that examines connections between gender, sexuality, and work as conceptualized by Marx and the early Socialists who preceded him. Close analyses of several key sequences will demonstrate that Metropolis translates cinematically the inversion of causality between work and sexuality that Marx introduced after the Saint-Simonians, from whom he otherwise distanced himself. By keeping women either completely outside the cinematic space or relegating them to certain strategic roles within the narrative, Harbou and Lang move towards their own understanding of the relationship between work, gender, and sexuality, suggesting that cinema not only reflects, but actively participates in the creation and maintenance of the status quo.

Karst	Duke Law Journal	1984	3	1984-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 447-508	Duke University School of Law	fla		The idea of woman is a social construct. Professor Karst begins by considering some of the sources of that construct, and how American law has both reflected and reinforced it. Next, he discusses the role of constitutional law in the modern reconstruction of "woman's place," and examines the limitations of that transformation. Finally, recognizing that women as a group do tend to perceive social relations and approach moral issues in distinctive ways, Professor Karst speculates on the possible consequences of a reconstruction of our constitutional law to include an important measure of that distinctive morality and worldview.

This article explores some likely explanations. Focusing on efforts to end xenophobia and counter male violence, the argument is made that the drive toward social justice is remarkable less for the claims being made by European women's movements than for the road on which many activists must now mobilize. Though the Union provides a potential venue for social change, women are at a particular disadvantage in gaining significant access to that venue.

I characterize four major perspectives from which situations of oppression or victimization can be seen and questions about choice and responsibility answered: The Perspective of the Oppressor; The Perspective of the Victim; The Perspective of the Responsible Actor; and The Perspective of the Observer/Philosopher. I compare their strengths and weaknesses and discuss their compatibility.

The Theatrical Militancy of Billionaires for Bush and Reverend Billy	Bleuwenn Lechaux	International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society	23	2/3	2010-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 175-190	Springer	fla		This article, grounded on a fieldwork conducted in 2007 and 2008 in New York City, aims at analyzing the social usages and effects of artistic and ironic actions led by two activist collectives: Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping and the Billionaires for Bush. The first organization is opposed to excessive consumerism and denounces actors, like multinational corporations, involved in the privatization of public spaces in New York City. The second collective—by using forms of action and ironic slogans pretending to endorse US government decisions regarding tax cuts and, more generally, any law favouring privileged groups—condemns policies which widen social inequalities. The resort to artistic and ironic actions assumes denouncing and non-preaching characteristics. First, these actions target elected people or institutions perceived as responsible for the social, economic, and political problems identified by the collectives. Then, the activists tend to criticize and disassociate from connotations which to them are associated with certain forms of religious ceremonies and political activism, delivering sermons and preaching to the choir. A major interest of the non-preaching nature of these artistic and ironic actions would precisely lie in their capacity to sensitize outside the social circles of converted activists. The article first examines formal transfers between art and activism—narratives, costumes, musical repertoires—drawing on US cultural and religious references while taunting them. The analytical description of these actions will lead to a critical insight into their political and social effects. To which extent do these musical and theatrical forms of protest have the capacity to call political beliefs into question, to arm convinced activists, to convert the undecided, or even the opponents to the causes championed by these protest groups?

Parsons	Ethical Theory and Moral Practice	4	4	2001-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 365-382	Springer	fla		This paper offers a critical investigation of the theological assumptions that lie within three forms of modern feminist ethics, with a view to challenging feminist ethics to enter the new theological possibilities opened up in postmodernity for the conceiving of God. The first part of the paper considers the conceiving of God in modern feminisms, in which theology becomes ethics. The consequences of this development are considered. The second part of the paper investigates the turn into postmodernity which hears the saying of the death of God and the critique of onto-theology. This disturbance to the foundations of feminist ethics is understood as part of a wider critique of humanism manifest particularly in gender theory. That the end of the modern human subject might allow a conceiving of God through an understanding of the performative is the restored orthodoxy to which the paper points.

I argue that this cultural geography informed Neo-Impressionist Paul Signac's vision of an anarchist future to be situated on France's Mediterranean shore. With such an alternative cultural construct, Signac reconfigured the classical pastoral, using its inherent capacity for juxtaposition to claim the Mediterranean coast as a site for politically critical avant-garde art.

Casting Goldman as a lovesick radical, Herzog invites us to read her activism and politics as an affective stance resulting in an accurate critique of the Soviet state. This move countenances Herzog's perverted depiction of Goldman as a swooning girl in love with anarchism and authorizes his lack of engagement with her searing political critique of capitalism and liberal democracy. Hence, Herzog's strategy--to read Goldman's politics as an emotional stance--serves to undermine precisely the sort of political engagement he claims to celebrate.

Friedman	Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians	51	3	1992-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 239-260	Society of Architectural Historians, University of California Press	fla		Aline Barnsdall's letters to her friends and associates in the American theater community in the 1910s provide the starting point for a discussion of her central role in the planning of Hollyhock House, the sprawling mansion that Frank Lloyd Wright designed for her on Olive Hill in Los Angeles (1919-1921). With its open courtyard, roof terraces, and semicircular garden, Hollyhock House has long been recognized by both Wright scholars and casual visitors as a flexible yet rather awkward open-air theater. An outspoken feminist and ardent supporter of populist causes, Barnsdall sought to make her home the centerpiece of an extensive theatrical community on Olive Hill. She was also devoted to outdoor theater, a form which she and other progressive thinkers viewed as a way of bringing significant ideas to the American public in healthy surroundings. Reexamination of the project in light of these circumstances suggests not only the sources for Wright's design in contemporary open-air theater but also the specific symbolic and functional role that Hollyhock House was to play in the overall project. Wright's correspondence with Barnsdall and the description of her in his Autobiography reveal the intensity and ambivalence of his response to the commission and to his brilliant, outspoken, creative-and undoubtedly infuriating-client.

La "délégation à l'étranger" duparti exista jusqu'en 1951 et le journal du parti, Sotsialisticheskii vestnik, continua d'être publié jusqu'en 1963. Cet article essaie d'expliquer la longévité du parti en fonction de trois facteurs: les facteurs "historiques" qui découlent du fait que les mencheviks en exil représentent une génération distincte, celle qui a atteint sa maturité politique dans la Révolution de 1905, et qu'ils partagent des origines et une identité sociale communes; les facteurs "organisationnels" liés à une politique d'exclusivité et à la discipline sévère du parti, rappelant la tradition bolchevique plutôt que menchevique; les facteurs "situationnels" dictés par les conditions de l'exil qui imposèrent une solidarité inconditionnelle, malgré les divergences de vues ou d'idées, au sein de la "famille" menchevik. Tous ces facteurs contribuèrent non seulement à la longévité du parti mais également à un rayonnement tout à fait disproportionné par rapport aux effectifs et aux moyens modestes du parti.

Paul Feyerabend's arguments that "science is an essentially anarchistic enterprise" in his Against Method are extended to social scientific thought. Distinctions are drawn between methodological and sociopolitical anarchism. Feyerabend's criticisms of methodological consistency are discussed. 'Facts' are problematic conceptualizations whose constituent elements are to be found in older theories and, therefore, are biased against new and progressive discoveries. An argument is made against any and all single closed methodological-theoretical systems. Historical examples of anarchistic methodology in the social sciences are tendered. An argument is developed to support Feyerabend's assertion that such uniformity following from a single system "endangers the free development of the individual."

Jacqueline Stevens, Rogers Smith	The American Political Science Review	89	4	1995-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 987-995	American Political Science Association	fla		Rogers Smith in "Beyond Tocqueville, Myrdal and Hartz: The Multiple Traditions in America" in the September 1993 issue of this Review argues that ascriptive inequalities (eg. racism, sexism, nativism) are neither mere deviations from liberalism nor only symptoms of liberalism. Rather, multiple ideologies coexist in uneasy tension. Jacqueline Stevens criticizes Smith for failing to attend to the work of W. E. B. Du Bois and others--whose descriptions of American ideological history, she says, provide the same insight that Smith claims as his own. She goes on to discuss how defining a "mainstream" of scholarship shapes inferences as to what counts as knowledge and further suggests that liberalism and exclusion betray an underlying consistency. In his reply, Smith recognizes the contributions of Du Bois and others, but argues that although they do foreshadow his work, they do not offer the same critique or do the same job. And he asserts that the linkages between liberalism and ascriptive inequality are political, economic, social and psychological--not logical--ones.

The Socialist Party has not been a significant political force since the early twentieth century. A content analysis of the Appeal to Reason, the most popular Socialist newspaper of this era, reveals weaknesses in the Socialist Party's methods for inaugurating socialism. The Socialist Party did not offer a distinct alternative to the major parties because it moderated its demands in order to appeal to middle class voters. The major parties absorbed these liberal policies and the Socialist Party lost its strength.

The end of the Cold War, the election of a liberal President in the United States, and an unprecedented level of participation by nongovernmental organizations contributed to a political environment in which orthodox population policy was devalued. In its place, the conference outlined a "new paradigm" in which the reduction of global population growth was replaced by an individual-level model with women's health, rights, status, and empowerment at its heart. The authors argue that this result was primarily a consequence of an extraordinarily effective campaign undertaken by the international women's movement. The article analyzes the politics of the main protagonists: the women's movement, the United States government, and the Holy See. The authors conclude that there is a disjunction between the political process that produced the Program of Action and the strategies that will be required to mobilize the resources and commitment for its implementation.

In its pages appeared the writings of prominent political figures such as Rosa Luxemburg and Eugene Debs and those of such noted authors as Leo Tolstoy and Maxim Gorky. The lively content of the magazine also included poetry, songs, folktales, essays, and cartoons as well as a revisionist history of the United States from the Revolutionary War through Reconstruction. These features of the 15-18 page newspaper-size magazine were used to construct a working-class cultural identification in children that was tied to radical socialist activity. The cultural articles created role models and an alternative value structure while the political articles forged an allegiance to socialist politics. The unique feature of using sophisticated reading materials for children to develop a cultural identification tied to radical politics provides one model for developing oppositional cultural forms. This model may prove useful to educators today who are redesigning curricular materials to include race, ethnicity, gender, and class perspectives that have been marginalized from mainstream texts.

That Protestant left was the left wing of the social gospel movement, which many historians restrict to the pre-1920 period and whose radical content is often underestimated. This article examines the career of one representative figure from this Protestant left, the Reverend Harry F. Ward, as a means of describing the evolving nature and limits of social gospel radicalism during the first four decades of the twentieth century. Ward, the main author of the 1908 Social Creed of the Churches, a longtime professor at Union Theological Seminary (UTS) in New York, and a dogged activist on behalf of labor and political prisoners through his leadership of the Methodist Federation for Social Service, sought a new social order from the early years of the century through the Great Depression of the 1930s. This new order would be the Kingdom of God on earth, and, in Ward's view, it would transcend the competitive and exploitative capitalism that dominated American society in his time. Before World War I, Ward worked to bring together labor activists and church people, and, after the war, he shifted his work toward less expressly religious efforts, while continuing to mentor clerical protégés through his teaching. Ward's leftward trajectory and ever-stronger Communist associations would eventually bring about his political downfall, but, in the mid-1930s, he remained a respected figure, if one more radical than most, among American Protestant clergy. Organic links tied him and his politics to the broader terrain of social gospel reform, despite the politically driven historical amnesia that later would all but erase Ward from historical memory.

Jansen	American Journal of Sociology	112	4	2007-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 953-1007	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The Zapatistas and Sandinistas both invoked historical figures in their rhetoric, but they did so in very different ways. This variation is explained by a model of path‐dependent memory work that is sensitive to how previous memory struggles enable and constrain subsequent uses of historical figures. Specifically, previous struggles produce distinct reputational trajectories that condition the potential utility of different modes of memory work. The cases illustrate two reputational trajectories, which are situated within a broader field of mnemonic possibilities. This article offers a provisional baseline for comparing contested memory projects and supplies a framework for analyzing the opportunities and constraints by which reputational trajectories condition memory work. It builds on a recent processual emphasis in the collective memory literature and suggests that the contentious politics literature needs to historicize its conception of culture and take seriously the operation of constraints on symbolic work.

These deviant patterns manifest a spirit of rebelliousness and have taken three major forms in American life: delinquency, radicalism, and Bohemianism. Each has been a subterranean tradition of American youth. The subterranean tradition of delinquency, which is guided by a celebration of prowess, manifests a spirit of adventure, disdain of work, and aggression. The delinquent enterprise consists primarily of victimization and status offenses. Radicalism is guided by an apocalyptic vision, populism, and evangelism. The radical enterprise consists of mundane political activity that, to its participants, seems extraordinary as a result of unconventional definitions of politics. The Bohemian tradition and beat, its modern manifestation, are committed to romanticism, expressive authenticity, and monasticism. Because of the importance of expressive authenticity, Bohemianism has taken two major paths, friviolous and morose. The Bohemian enterprise consists of two interrelated features, unconventional art and unconventional personal experience. While only a small proportion of youth participates in any of these traditions, many more are vulnerable. That more do not participate and that many who do participate return to conventional life seem related to the existence of conventional versions of these traditions.

They conceive of Geek Group as a radical pedagogical activity, which constitutes an aspect of activism surrounding citizen access to low-power FM radio. They are also concerned with combating the gendered nature of hardware skills, yet in spite of their efforts men tend to have more skill and familiarity with radio hardware than women. Radio tinkering has a long history as a masculine undertaking and a site of masculine identity construction. I argue that this case represents an interplay between geek, activist, and gendered identities, all of which are salient for this group, but which do not occur together without some tension.

This tragic event saw the death of 19 miners, fired upon by local law enforcement and a posse gathered from local businessmen. This paper will situate this event amidst the deeply turbulent themes underlying the Gilded Age: race, American exceptionalism and Empire and labor struggle. A project undertaken by archaeologists from the University of Maryland seeks to restore the memory of the massacre, highlighting the implications of this history within the current anti-immigrant politics extant in its contemporary setting.

The emphasis on materiality and proximity links the haptic visuality of In the Shadow of No Towers to other visual practices memorializing 9/11 that withdraw to the local landscape of the neighborhood and demonstrates the challenge posed by the images of 9/11 to historical interpretation.

This paper addresses that question by analyzing the memory trajectory of one well- remembered event in American history, the Homestead Strike of 1892. Tracking the traces of the strike, from tragic event to collective memory, it examines how the collective memory of an event enhances our ability to document and understand it in its entirety, demonstrating that while records may influence the memory of events, memory may also influence the production of records.

Instead, we demonstrate that leading nineteenth-century American women's rights advocates-Hannah Mather Crocker, Lucretia Mott, Sarah Grimké, Margaret Fuller, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony-understood themselves to be in a critical, philosophical dialogue with the text of the Rights of Woman, and in some cases, the Memoirs, and defined their own, distinctive philosophies of sex equality partly within this context.

Ideology regarding appropriate roles for women and men, as providers and consumers of social services, reflected complex perceptions and principles. Social work was moved both to protect and to empower its clients. It justified women's roles in social service as being consistent with the social norm of nurturance, but it also encouraged women to create careers and personal lives that were powerful, liberating, and autonomous.

Yet it is difficult to find even a single theoretical article on the historical or contemporary forms of feminist internationalism. There is, also, limited historical or contemporary research directly on the problem. It is therefore necessary to first ask why this might be so and then suggest how the vacuum might be filled. The extensive literature around the subject does provide a sufficient basis for such theorising. There also exists a relevant body of feminist and other emancipatory writing which could contribute to the construction of such a theory. There remains a need for identifying the various possible fields for specialised research, and rubrics for possible overviews. We also need theoretically-informed studies of cases, types, forms and axes of international solidarity with and between women.

It draws parallels with the work of Jewish-American women in the theater, from Sophie Tucker to Eve Ensler. The activism of these feminist artists fits in with the heritage of Jews, who, motivated by their belief in social justice and desire for political reform, turned to radical politics, first in eastern Europe and then in America. Some of this sexually explicit work has provoked attempts at censorship, disregarding the frequently metaphoric force of the subject. The works of art and the struggles summarized in this paper should heighten awareness that the drive for free expression in art is intimately linked with women's quest to claim their sexuality, agency and power, and that Jewish women have been among the pioneers in that quest.

Resident aliens and members of the Palestine Liberation Organization are excepted from section 901 and are, therefore, subject to ideological exclusion. This Comment criticizes those exceptions, arguing that they violate the first amendment. Before addressing the first amendment challenge, the author argues that the plenary power doctrine, which severely limits judicial review of immigration legislation, should not bar these challenges for either of two reasons: (1) because the doctrine should be categorically abandoned, or (2) because there exists a first amendment exception to the doctrine. After concluding that courts are not prohibited from entertaining the first amendment challenge, the Comment evaluates the exceptions to section 901 by applying the test in United States v. O'Brien, with reference to Brandenburg v. Ohio. Working under the assumption that the congressional purpose behind the exceptions is to interdict terrorism, the Comment concludes that the exceptions are overly broad, since they do not involve an individualized determination of propensity to commit terrorism, and they add nothing that is not already provided by a different exception to section 901 for terrorist activity. Furthermore, the Comment argues that if the purpose behind the PLO exception is to express antagonism toward the PLO, the exception still fails the O'Brien test, since there are other ways to pursue that interest without encroaching on first amendment interests.

Van Houten	The Sociological Quarterly	18	1	1977-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 108-125	Midwest Sociological Society, Wiley	fla		Systematic study of the sociology of organizations is almost absent in both the classical and modern Marxist traditions. Although some recent studies in the Marxist tradition show considerable promise, the field has been dominated by the Weberian perspective. The development of new theory should be informed by the Marxian concepts of (a) labor theory of value, (b) the forces and relations of production, (c) historical development of capitalism, and (d) class structure and class struggle. Bourgeois organizational theory has some serious deficiencies, but there is much of value that can be subsumed under the broader rubric of Marxist political economy. The potential for a Marxist theory of bureaucracy is explored in an examination of managerial strategies to minimize external uncertainties in a monopoly capitalist system, and internal uncertainties arising from the work force. Strategies for controlling the work force include the division of labor, organizational hierarchy, rules and procedures, the uses of secrecy and hoarding of knowledge, and the maintenance of ethnic and sexual divisions in the work force. Further research is needed on (a) differentiating capital accumulation and social control strategies, (b) comparisons between workers in the state and corporate sectors, (c) comparisons between work organization under full range of socialist economies and those in capitalist economies in both manufacturing and government and (d) alternatives for the future.

Ewell, Kathryn Cirksena, Margaret McFadden	NWSA Journal	10	1	1998-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 57-78	The Johns Hopkins University Press	fla		To commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Fulbright Scholar Program in 1996 and to help set the agenda for the next half century, five former Fulbright professors, all of them women from the United States, recount the life-altering experiences they had while teaching and doing research under the program's auspices in Germany, Mexico, Chile, Romania, and Finland during the 1980s and 1990s. In separate but related essays, the five authors, all of whom are feminists, describe the various challenges and opportunities they encountered in their host countries. Among the issues discussed are the underrepresentation of women in the Fulbright program; the problems the authors faced as researchers, teachers, partners, and parents living and working abroad; the rewards they reaped from sharing their feminist perspective and pedagogy with students in other countries; and the global understanding of Women's Studies and women's concerns they gained from their experience as Fulbright fellows. The authors' goals are to encourage readers to support the program and to inspire women scholars who have not yet considered doing so to apply for Fulbright grants.

Few defend the idea that knowledges such as the human sciences are merely representational practices. Instead, knowledge is approached as a social power to be analyzed for its social productivity. Assuming a tight link between knowledge and power, this paper aims to sketch a non-Whiggish framework for narrating the development of human sciences. I underscore how the scientization of social knowledge has, on the one hand, produced subaltern interpretative communities and, on the other hand, how these communities-as the repressed unconscious of the human sciences-have continued to shape and trouble the epistemic and social claims to authority by the human sciences.

A member of the Socialist Party, she was particularly outspoken in her opposition to the First World War, a conflict she identified as a "capitalistic war" which in no sense served the interests of the working class. After the United States joined the struggle in April 1917, Keller was an impassioned supporter of Emma Goldman, Eugene Debs, and other radicals sent to prison as a result of their antiwar activities.

The historical analysis focuses on relations between feminists and neo-Malthusians and attempts to determine when they are likely to enter into alliances. The two movements are found to be neither natural allies nor natural enemies. Sturdy alliances arise when both movements agree on certain ideological premises, share a common demographic goal, and perceive mutual benefit in an alliance. The origin of the "common ground" alliance between American feminists and American neo-Malthusians that was so prominently displayed at the International Conference on Population and Development at Cairo is examined. Since the two movements currently are found to possess no clear common goals, to share no basic ideological beliefs, and to have entered a relationship of questionable mutual benefit, the alliance is considered to be fragile.

Often discriminated against in labour markets, and socially marginalized in new environments, Russo-Polish males either persisted in, or resorted to, organized crime centred on the illicit sale of alcohol, professional gambling, and prostitution to survive. Atlantic states, however, were reluctant to employ Jews as uniformed police or detectives in their fight against syndicated crime. In order to overcome the challenge of ethnicized crime, law-enforcement agencies, like nineteenth-century tsarist administrations before them, employed informers. Jewish informers who, unbeknown to police handlers, were sometimes also psychopaths in an era before the condition was clinically identified, were used to infiltrate underworld structures. By nature, informing offered a short-term, unstable, existence fraught with unintended consequences for police and spies alike-thereby encouraging extraordinary geographical mobility amongst informers. Orthodox histories of law-enforcement agencies tend to focus on structural changes in police forces but a re-examination of the role of informers in organized crime should allow for the development of more subtle insights into the evolution of policing as a dynamic, interactive, social process.

Four factions are identified: immigration restrictionists, eugenicists, birth controllers, and population scientists. The history and ideological orientation of each group is outlined. The period was characterized by dissension, as different ideological perspectives produced discordant appraisals of population trends. Biological Malthusians focused on compositional changes in population and their impact on genetic quality; classic Malthusians focused on changes in numbers and their impact on economic properity. The valuation dimension of demographic assessment is highlighted by surveying population thought in an era of advocacy and controversy.

Revolutions are also a potent cause of instability and war, because they alter the "balance of threats" between the revolutionary state and the other members of the system. First, revolutions alter the balance of power and make it more difficult for states to measure it accurately. Second, they encourage states to exaggerate each other's hostility, further increasing perceptions of threat. Third, revolutions cause states to exaggerate both their own vulnerability and that of their opponents, thereby encouraging them to view the use of force as both necessary and feasible. This combination of insecurity and overconfidence is usually illusory, however. In fact, revolutions are usually harder either to export or to reverse than either side expects.

As a mentor to many women who joined the "Cultural" and "Pragmatic" feminists of Hull House, her secular theories of "Oekology" and "Euthenics" challenged many of the models of social change prevalent in the Cambridge and Chicago academic communities. Her most radical contribution as a feminist was her assertion that women's unpaid labor in the home played a vital economic role in maintaining capitalism and was the ultimate source of their second-class citizenship. She shared a belief in democracy and education as a feminist "Pragmatist," and laid the groundwork for the contemporary "Ecofeminist" movement. Although she was a biochemist by training, she engaged several generations of women in the application of scientific methods to the solution of contemporary social problems. As a political organizer, much of her legacy is reflected in the accomplishments of the reform organizations she was instrumental in founding.

From its inception in 1919, its guiding principle was freedom: freedom of opinion, of teaching, of research, of publication. Initially focusing on the social sciences, by 1927 it introduced music as a significant part of that program. The School's social science perspective, its educational unorthodoxies, and its liberal philosophical ideals set a distinctive tone, nurturing an unfettered and accepting haven for a progressive community of musical personalities. Most prominent among them stood Henry Cowell, but Paul Rosenfeld, Aaron Copland, Charles Seeger, and others also contributed to the vitality of the School. From 1927 until 1933, Cowell presided over a program of lectures, concerts, symposia, and workshops dedicated to the cause of contemporary American music. In view of the School's adult population, music was treated primarily as an intellectual and cultural pursuit that stimulated new spheres of musical inquiry. At the same time, the influence of the social sciences encouraged the study of music through the political and social lens of culture. The diversity and singularity of these approaches created a new context for music and a significant contribution to the history of US musical culture.

But what about the millions of non-literate Europeans? How were they incorporated in the nation-building process? This article suggests answers to these questions by focusing on the spread of literacy in late nineteenth-century Spain. It discusses a broader notion of public education, spurred in large part by Spanish print culture, as part of a complex interaction that resulted in a larger, more politically active citizenry in turn of the century Spain with obvious parallels for other European nations. This article also suggests that there are myriad ways to educate a populace outside the restrictions of a formal state education system. Spanish newspapers were at the vanguard of this informal education system, but were not the only means of political transmission of ideas. Simultaneously, reading clubs and other extra-state educational and political bodies developed that also used newspapers, along with other materials, to politicize Spaniards. The result, as I show here, was a symbiotic relationship between the press, the state, and Spanish citizens that altered the direction of educational reform while it broadened the numbers of politically-active Spaniards.

Jewish anarchists were rumoured to have been responsible for the 'ripper' murders in Whitechapel (1888), an attempt to blow up the Royal Observatory at Greenwich Park (1894) and the Houndsditch murders (1910)/Sidney Street affair (1911). Jews were a visible population in the East End, and editors, MPs, and police authorities offered Jewishness to explain the 'who' and 'why' of anarchist violence. Jews were also thought to have the capacity to become invisible, 'outsiders' who could pass for 'insiders'. In the radical press, and fictionalised accounts in novels such as Conrad's The Secret Agent, the image of the Jewish anarchist became that of agent provocateur paid by police to infíltrate and undermine the movement. Jews were said to operate behind-the-scenes, manipulating the economy and political structure. The invisible hand of the market and the invisible hand of anarchism were attached to a Jewish body.

Charlene Haddock Seigfried	Hypatia	6	2	1991-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-20	Hypatia, Inc., Wiley	fla		Unlike our counterparts in Europe who have rewritten their specific cultural philosophical heritage, American feminists have not yet critically reappropriated our own philosophical tradition of classical American pragmatism. The neglect is especially puzzling, given that both feminism and pragmatism explicitly acknowledge the material or cultural specificity of supposedly abstract theorizing. In this article I suggest some reasons for the neglect, call for the rediscovery of women pragmatists, reflect on a feminine side of pragmatism, and point out some common features. The aim is to encourage the further development of a feminist revisioning of pragmatism and a pragmatist version of feminism.

Moore	In Vitro	20	6	1984-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 463-472	Society for In Vitro Biology	fla		Cell lines corresponding to various cell lineages of the mouse embryo have been isolated from murine teratocarcinomas. Embryonal carcinoma cell lines are developmentally equivalent to the embryonic ectoderm or inner cell mass. Most of these cell lines have a modal chromosome number equal or close to 40, the normal mouse complement. However, cell lines corresponding to more advanced cell lineages (e.g., endoderm) are tetraploid or hypotetraploid and display multiple chromosomal rearrangements. This paper describes the isolation of a near-diploid differentiated cell line (LT-D) from an LT teratocarcinoma. The modal chromosome number of LT-D is 40, and this number is stable during at least 12 mo of continuous culture. LT-D cells are morphologically distinct from embryonal carcinoma cells and no longer express the SSEA-1 cell surface antigen or high alkaline phosphatase activity characteristic of embryonal carcinoma cells. LT-D cells can be induced to fuse into structures resembling myotubes. The formation of these structures is accompanied by expression of the muscle-specific isozyme of creatine phosphokinase and desmin, a muscle-specific component of intermediate filaments. Lastly, LT-D cells do not form tumors in syngenetic mice.

The novel is used to uncover the process by which a naive notion of history as something always already fixed can be deconstructed and substituted by a conception of the absolute indeterminacy of the past. Eternal flux and change become the essence of the past, a past which is always being rewritten. This latter conception is then ascribed to fiction as a valid «speculative history.» History is a kind of fiction in which we live and hope to survive, and fiction is a kind of speculative history, or a superhistory, by which the available data for the composition is seen to be greater and more various in its sources than the historian supposes ... There is no fiction or non fiction as we commonly understand the distinction: there is only narrative.

The McCarthy period was no exception. During the late 1940s and early 1950s thousands of aliens and naturalized citizens were threatened with deportation and otherwise punished because of their left-wing connections (or, in many cases, former connections). Immigrant leftists provided the federal government with popular and relatively noncontroversial opportunities for action against domestic communism during the Cold War era. But bureaucratic disputes among government agencies and prolonged litigation carried out by immigrant defense groups diminished the efficacy of such repression. Despite a lack of formal constitutional protection, many political undesirables managed to avoid deportation, but at the considerable personal and political costs of damaged lives and destroyed organizations.

Yet, social work educators most often present issues of race and gender separately, drawing upon two distinct bodies of literature. The author reviews the existing literature on women of color, focusing on five dominant themes that address interactions among race, gender, and other factors in the lives of women of color. Several curriculum models are described that offer approaches to teaching material on women of color to social workers. She then suggests the use of the case example as an effective method for conveying this material. A specific case example, African American mothers of disabled children, is used to address each of the five themes presented in the literature review. Specific pedagogical techniques are suggested for using the case example approach and the five themes in class.

It argues that Dos Passos's trips to Spain and the many publications that resulted from them provided the model for his ideal of an anti-nationalist, anti-capitalist literature of a diverse federation of autonomous communities. Against the vision of his father, who joined American imperialists in celebrating the Spanish-American War of 1898, Dos Passos sees Spain's imperial decline and national disintegration as a boon for its flourishing literature, and America's victory as another harmful blow to its culture. That is, he restages the war and inverts its impact through literary commentaries and translations. This inversion then informs several of his own works, too, including A Pushcart to the Curb (1922) and Manhattan Transfer (1925).

The One Big Union and the Politics of Radical Manhood	Todd McCallum	Labour / Le Travail	42		1998-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 15-54	Athabasca University Press, Canadian Committee on Labour History	fla		In march 1919, over 230 union delegates assembled at the Western Labor Conference in Calgary to chart a radical new direction for wage workers through the creation of a revolutionary industrial union centre, the One Big Union (OBU). This essay argues that the practices of the OBU's radical manhood, their particular sense of what it meant to be a union man, shaped the organization's structure and politics as well as the emergent culture which fostered such widespread working-class radicalism. Drawing upon already existing practices espoused by Canadian labourists and American Wobblies as well as fashioning new ones, OBU men distinguished radical manhood from both the class politics and the masculinities of male bosses and scabs. While the organization of working women was not seen as an important issue at the WLC, the upsurge in women's militancy during the labour revolt prompted OBU supporters to encourage these women to join their male comrades. At times, advocates of the One Big Union posed the questions of women's oppression and emancipation as crucial elements of the union's purpose; their infrequent ideological commitment, however, too often failed to translate into organizational gains for working-class women and the development of feminist practices within the union. In their challenge to the bourgeois order, OBU men created a program that, in the prevailing context of gender relations, meant that the One Big Union would bring about the transformation, but not the eradication, of men's power. /// En mars 1919, plus de 230 délégués syndicaux se réunissent au Congrès du Travail de l'Ouest à Calgary dans le but d'opérer un virage radical chez les travailleurs salariés par la création d'une nouvelle centrale: la One Big Union. Le présent article démontre que dans l'OBU, les pratiques viriles des travailleurs radicaux, leur perception du syndicaliste, vu comme d'abord masculin, moulèrent la structure et les politiques de la nouvelle organisation, de même que la nouvelle culture associée au radicalisme ouvrier. Les hommes de l'OBU, s'inspirant des travaillistes canadiens et des Wobblies américains, tout en forgeant des pratiques inédites, se distinguaient à la fois de la politique de classe des autres syndicats et de la masculinité des patrons et des briseurs de grève. Si le Congrès négligea l'organisation des travailleuses, leur militantisme pendant la révolte ouvrière de 1919 poussa l'OBU à encourager les femmes à se joindre à leur camarades masculins. Pour certains membres de l'OBU, la question de l'oppression féminine constituait un élément fondamental des programmes syndicaux. Ces rares engagements idéologiques n'apportèrent cependant aucun gain pour les femmes de la classe ouvrière, pas plus qu'ils n'inspirèrent de pratiques tant soit peu féministes dans les syndicats. En défiant l'ordre bourgeois, les hommes de l'OBU mirent sur pied un programme qui, dans le contexte des rapports de sexe alors en vigueur, résultèrent en une transformation mais non en l'extirpation du pouvoir masculin.

It assimilated the cult of manliness - the key public virtue, which allowed a person to claim possession of himself and a nation to reclaim possession of itself. An army was the means of marshalling a mass of people for regeneration. The symbol of a nation's preparedness to take control of its own soul was the readiness to bear arms. Although this movement originated in the middle-class, Protestant cultures of the USA and England, its core ideas were adopted by many political movements. Affected by these ideas, as well as the formation of the Protestant Ulster Volunteers in 1913, a movement to reclaim Irish independence through the mass bearing of arms began in South and West Ireland in autumn 1914. Women were excluded from these Volunteer companies, but set up their own organization, Cumann na mBan, as an auxiliary to the men's. The Easter Rising in 1916 owed as much to older ideas of the coup d'état as new ideas of mass mobilization, but subsequent history recreated that Rising as the 'founding' moment of the Irish republic. It was not until mass conscription was threatened two years later that the mass of people were absorbed into the idea of an armed campaign against British rule. From 1919 to 1923, the reality of guerrilla-style war pressed people into a frame demanding discipline, secrecy, loyalty and a readiness to act as the prime nationalist virtues. The ideal form of relationship in war is the brotherhood, both as actuality and potent myth. The mythology of brotherhood creates its own myths of women (as not being there, and men not needing them) as well as creating the fear and the myth that rape is the inevitable expression of brotherhoods in action. Despite explicit anxiety at the time about the rape of Irish women by British soldiers, no evidence was found of mass rape, and that fear has disappeared into oblivion, throwing up important questions as to when rape is a weapon of war. The decade of war worsened the relationship of women to the political realm. Despite active involvement as 'auxiliaries' women's political status was permanently damaged by their exclusion as warriors and brothers, so much so that they disappear into the status of wives and mothers in the 1937 Irish Constitution.

His participation in the Armory Show included essays and translations which, like most of his writing, were directed to the intelligent layman rather than the specialist or connoisseur. Pach's critical perceptions are here analyzed, with particular attention given his interests in formalism and evolutionary historicism. The growth of his career from spokesman for modernism to defender of "classic" aesthetic principles is established, and his often equivocal attitude to American art is described.

This mode of outdoor speaking developed from the traditions of stump speaking and public meetings that prevailed in the antebellum period. Soapbox orators set up temporary platforms on street corners, and in squares and parks. They used words, images, sounds, and bodies to attract passersby and engage with them on a variety of issues. Their lively performances temporarily disrupted everyday activities and transformed places into vibrant spaces for public deliberation. Soapboxing's vision of the city as a site for free speech and free assembly intersected with the visual and spatially cohesive urbanism of city planners around 1910. Case studies of Chicago, New York, and Spokane illustrate different ways that residents of these three cities attempted to balance the tension between unpredictability and order represented by soapboxing and city planning, respectively. Local solutions gave way during World War I to federal laws against sedition that entailed harsh criticism and sometimes violent repression of street speakers who dared criticize the war or the country. In the 1920s, soapboxing remained a popular form of oratory in communities like Harlem, where residents were denied access to indoor spaces for political discourse. The practice has ebbed and flowed in the ensuing years, and has recently enjoyed a resurgence with Occupy Wall Street and its various incarnations around the United States and the world.

Reform-minded economists argued that the labor force should be rid of unfit workers--whom they labeled "unemployables," "parasites," and the "industrial residuum"--so as to uplift superior, deserving workers. Women were also frequently classified as unemployable. Leading progressives, including women at the forefront of labor reform, justified exclusionary labor legislation for women on grounds that it would (1) protect the biologically weaker sex from the hazards of market work; (2) protect working women from the temptation of prostitution; (3) protect male heads of household from the economic competition of women; and (4) ensure that women could better carry out their eugenic duties as "mothers of the race." What united these heterogeneous rationales was the reformers' aim of discouraging women's labor-force participation.

The Rosetti/Meredith novel suggests a likely point of access to contemporary anarchist versions of the incident. More importantly, carefully delineated and documented here is the broader historical mind-set out of which the novel emerged.

Each purported to replace Los Angeles's original Chinatown, which was demolished to make way for Union Station. They shared the purposes of providing entertainment, food, and shopping to locals as well as tourists to the city. Yet they differed significantly. China City was a tourist and shopping district that traded in the sentimentalized stereotypes of Old China, and it was owned and operated by a corporation of white owners. New Chinatown presented a modernized vision of the urban Chinatown and was owned and operated exclusively by Chinese Americans. The creation of these two districts was part of a larger project of urban beautification and historicist revivalism in Los Angeles in the 1930s, which echoed events in the nearby city of Santa Barbara. By examining these two replacement communities in comparison with one another and their immediate surroundings, this article pushes back against a prevalent dismissal of tourist historicism and considers these places as important documents of a complex negotiation between an established immigrant community and a modernizing city.

As parable, paraphrase, prophecy, and dramatic monologue, midrash offers an illuminating perspective on Louise Rosenblatt's "Literature as Exploration." Deeply influenced by libertarian ideals of her family, Rosenblatt crafted a unique philosophy in which the process of reading literature was intertwined with the aims of democratic citizenry. Working to understand her insistence on the need for imaginative extension helps us to recall a vanished ideal of democratic culture and the role that literature was to play within it.

Grabowski	The American Archivist	48	3	1985-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 304-314	Society of American Archivists	fla		Archives and manuscript repositories need to determine and enforce realistic collecting policies in order to create cohesive collections for research use and keep the size of their holdings within reasonable bounds, but this is difficult to accomplish because of constituency pressures and the impulse to compete with other institutions. The experience of an old and important regional repository, the Western Reserve Historical Society, particularly its Cleveland Regional Ethnic Archives Program begun in 1971, is the central focus of this article. The author describes how the society's collecting policy was defined and examines the evolution of collecting practice within the bounds of that policy. The successful implementation of the original policy has depended especially on three factors: good working relations with ethnic group leaders, selectivity within the scope of the policy, and cooperation among repositories.

Instead we would do better not to let the State define our intimate unions and parenting would be improved if the power presently concentrated in the hands of one or two guardians were diluted and distributed through an appropriately concerned community.

It has been fostered in a great variety of ways by so many, for such a long time, in all European countries that one might consider this form of hate and discrimination as inherent to European culture and a part of European "values." New European anti-Semitism often originates from a young age group, which indicates that it is an anti-Semitism of the future rather than of the past. The European Union's attitude toward anti-Semitism is double-handed. Through its discriminatory declarations and votes in international bodies the EU acts as an arsonist, fanning the flames of anti-Semitism in its anti-Israeli disguise. Simultaneously it also serves as fireman, trying to quench the flames of classic religious and ethnic anti-Semitism. France is paradigmatic of this approach. Although European anti-Semitism cannot be eradicated, certain steps can be taken to mitigate it. This requires a major change in discriminatory EU policies toward Israel. In the meantime there are increasing indications that the European battle against anti-Semitism may be used, to the contrary, to facilitate attacks on Israel.

Miller and Durrell influenced an anarchist revision of the socialist and communist orthodoxy of Surrealism. Their anarchist views, which retained surrealist aesthetics, played a major role in the international development of English language Surrealism prior to and during World War II. It had an impact on poets as diverse as David Gascoyne, Henry Treece, Robert Duncan and Kenneth Rexroth.

It has done so by drawing attention to the simultaneous and interacting effects of gender, race, class, sexual orientation, and national origin as categories of difference. Intersectional arguments and research findings have had varying levels of impact in feminist theory, social movements, international human rights, public policy, and electoral behavior research within political science and across the disciplines of sociology, critical legal studies, and history. Yet consideration of intersectionality as a research paradigm has yet to gain a wide foothold in political science. This article closely reads research on race and gender across subfields of political science to present a coherent set of empirical research standards for intersectionality.

George both accepted and challenged prevailing 19th-century expectations (within Western culture) of unlimited economic and social progress. The failure of later Georgists to adapt the substance and style of George's analysis in response to modern and post-modern issues may have been one factor contributing to the decline of Georgism during the 20th century. The effective end of the 19th century, symbolized by the sinking of the Titanic and realized by World War I, left unresolved to this day the socioeconomic problems of monopoly, privilege, and the commodification/exploitation of both labor and land--problems now associated with globalization. A revitalized Georgism could and would need to address these 21st-century realities.

We argue that the theory of anarchism presents a productive framework for analyzing decentralized societies. Anarchism encompasses a broad array of interrelated principles for organizing societies without the centralization of authority. Moreover, its theory of history emphasizes an ongoing and active resistance to concentrations of power. We present an anarchist analysis of the development of social power, authority, and status within the Coast Salish region of the Northwest Coast. Coast Salish peoples exhibited complex displays of chiefly authority and class stratification but without centralized political organization. Ethnographically, their sociopolitical formation is unique in allowing a majority of “high-class” people and a minority of commoners and slaves, or what Wayne Suttles described as an “inverted-pear” society. We present the development of this sociopolitical structure through an analysis of cranial deformation from burial data and assess it in relation to periods of warfare. We determine that many aspects of Coast Salish culture include practices that resist concentrations of power. Our central point is that anarchism is useful for understanding decentralized (or anarchic) networks—those that allow for complex intergroup relations while staving off the establishment of centralized political authority.

Rhetoric offers feminism a vibrant process of inquiring, organizing, and thinking, as well as a theorized space to talk about effective communication; feminism offers rhetoric a reason to bridge differences, to include, and to empower, as well as a politicized space to discuss rhetorical values. The fraditional rhetorical canons, with their enthymematic familiarity, mark the sections of this essay, for they emphasize the mutually heuristic nature of the border crossings between these two disdplines. Although the linearity of print demands that we treat the canons consecutively, they, nevertheless, have a tendency to overlap and interact. Our discussions of arrangement, style, and delivery, for instance, both assume and depend upon a rethinking of invention and memory—a rethinking that recognizes the role that both these canons play in current efforts to reconceptualize and reenact what it means to know, speak, and write. As our essay argues, such attention to what we speak about, and how and why we speak, urges ail of us not only to continued exploration and interrogation but also to a renewed responsibility for our professional and personal discursive acts.

At the Breakfast Program's peak in late 1969 and early 1970, the BPP and other volunteers fed thousands of children daily before they went to school across the country. The historic importance of the BPP's Breakfast Program rests both in the fact that it was imperative for the social reproduction of many inner-city communities and that it was both the model for, and impetus behind, all federally funded school breakfast programs currently in existence within the United States. At the heart of the BPP's Free Breakfast for Children Program and the spatial practices that led to its ultimate success are a set of scalar politics that played out as a result of (1) the failures of the U.S. national welfare state, (2) the BPP's evolved scaling of their revolutionary praxis, and (3) the local spatial practices they employed to serve the poor. All of these processes occurred despite attempts by the state to sabotage the BPP's political efforts. /// 黑豹党(BPP)最重要的政治成就之一就是他们的儿童兔费早餐计划. 在 1969 年后期和 70 年代初 期, 黑豹党儿童免费早餐计划的高峰期, 黑豹党和其他志愿者每天为全国各地学校数以干计的儿童 在他们上学之前提供食物. BPP 的旱餐计划的重要历史意义在于下远两点事实, 它是许多内城巿土区 巿土会再生产的当务之急, 它也是美国目前存在的联邦资助的学校早餐计划的模型和背后动力. BPP 的儿童免费早餐计划和地域实践导致其最终的成功, 其核心是下远尺度政治学所发挥的结果 (1) 美 国国家福利的失败, (2) BPP 革命实践的演变, 以及 (3) 所实行的为穷人服务的地域空间的实践 工作. 尽管国家企图干扰破环 BPP 的政治努力, 所有这些进程还是发生了. /// Uno de los logros políticos más importantes del Partido de las Panteras Negras (PPN) fue el éxito de su Programa de Desayunos Gratis para Niños. En la cúspide del Programa de Desayunos, a finales de 1969 y principios de 1970, el PPN y otros voluntarios alimentaron diariamente, antes de ir a la escuela, a miles de niños por todo el país. La importancia histórica del Programa de Desayundos del PPN estriba tanto en el hecho de que fue imperativo para la reproducción social de muchas comunidades de la ciudad, como en haberse constituido en el modelo y acicate para la implementación de todos los programas de desayuno escolar que hoy existen en los Estados Unidos, con financiación federal. Detrás del Programa de Desayunos Gratis para Niños del PPN, y de las prácticas espaciales que condujeron a su éxito final, se encuentra un conjunto de políticas que entraron en juego como resultado de (1) los fracasos de la gestión de bienestar social del gobierno, (2) la propia evolución de la praxis revolucionaria del PPN, y (3) las prácticas espaciales locales que ellos emplearon para servir a los pobres. Todos estos procesos se dieron a pesar de los intentos del estado para sabotear los esfuerzos políticos del PPN.

For each theory, a set of suggested readings is provided, and the author rates each theory on a number of criteria for evaluating theory. Several problems that sexual scientists must confront in building better theories are mentioned. Two specific issues of central concern to the field are discussed at length. The first is the need for refinement of the theoretical concepts of sexual phenomena. Investigation of power dynamics within sexual relationships is used as one example of this. The second issue is the need to develop and test explanatory models that identify correlates of such sexual concepts. Here, a possible explanatory model of social script internalization is presented.

Yet, no extended intervention study has been undertaken to test the effectiveness of primary source instruction in real history classrooms. This study, with 236 11th-grade students in five San Francisco high schools, represented the first extended curriculum intervention in disciplinary reading in an urban district. The Reading Like a Historian (RLH) curriculum constituted a radical departure from traditional textbook-driven instruction by using a new activity structure, the "Document-Based Lesson," in which students used background knowledge to interrogate, and then reconcile, historical accounts from multiple texts. A quasi-experiment control design measured the effects of a 6-month intervention on four dimensions: (a) students' historical thinking; (b) their ability to transfer historical thinking strategies to contemporary issues; (c) their mastery of factual knowledge; and (d) their growth in general reading comprehension. MANCOVA analysis yielded significant main effects for the treatment condition on all four outcome measures. This study has implications for both adolescent literacy instruction and history teaching at the middle- and high-school levels.

Ely and made significant contributions in economics before he moved into sociology. Ross was the John Kenneth Galbraith of the populist-progressive era. The similarity in background, methodology, Weltanschauung, and controversial academic and political styles of these men is discussed. Ross became a cause célébre after his dismissal from Stanford University in 1900 which became a major academic freedom case. Although he was a professional economist for only six years, Ross made original contributions in the areas of taxation, debt management, value theory, uncertainty, and location theory. The discussion of uncertainty as a factor in production precedes Knight's concept of risk and uncertainty and challenges neoclassical policy conclusions in a dynamic environment. His treatment of location theory includes a discussion of agglomeration, externalities, regional dualism, factor endowment, and comparative advantage to explain economic mobility.

I argue that among such grammars one expects to find one in which [SPEC,IP] is never a so-called A-position and in which syntactic verb movement to I is optional and that Modern Hebrew is an example of such a language. The first part of the paper is dedicated to evidence in favor of the optional nature of verb movement, while the second part explores the properties of [SPEC,IP] and the consequences which its non-A-status has for quantification, movement and word order.

Arguing that readers and viewers, as aesthetic subjects, are not pre-given individuals who then pick up a journal, this article maintains that audience members are themselves events, that they emerge from within the available opportunities to look and to read. Anarchist journals allowed aesthetic subjects to emerge, perhaps to thrive, through the process of self-creation and the making of a collective sensibility of resistance and hope.

Series B, Human Geography	84	3/4	2002-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 201-209	Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography, Wiley	fla		The word 'utopia' can mean both good place and no place, and the common-sense meaning of 'utopian' is unrealistic. This article argues that common-sense assumptions of the impossibility of utopia are ideological, and constructed in part by the way experiments in utopian living have been represented. Historical accounts suggest utopias are doomed to inevitable failure. In fiction and autobiography, committed participants in such experiments as well as outside observers use narrative structures which distance utopian spaces from 'real life'. Using historical research and textual analysis, this argument is illustrated by discussing several women involved in utopian politics in 1890s England. Four of them, Helen and Olivia Rossetti, Edith Lees, and Gertrude Dix later wrote novels which re-created but also distanced their experiences. This distancing is partly a function of gender: for them utopia was no place for real women. This paper analyses the construction of utopian spaces in their novels, particularly the gendered relationship between domestic and political space. Narrative structure, imagery and humour are all used to undermine a sense of the possibilities of utopian living. These fictionalised accounts are compared with Nellie Shaw's more positive non-fiction account of life in the utopian community Whiteway. Although writing as a committed utopian, she, too, creates an account that distances readers. The critical analysis of such representations can begin to challenge anti-utopianism.

It is also important to recognise the portion of his work that is historie morale. In the very best sense it is epic, encapsulating the hopes and dreams of a history of the American people in the early 1900s. It is a work that simultaneously pursues modernity and the past — for the sake of coping with the present. It also calls attention to an unnoticed element in his work 'inexperience'.

We observed that partisans tend to exaggerate differences of opinion with their adversaries. Further, we found that perceptions of disagreement were more pronounced for values that were central to the perceiver's own ideology than for values that were central to the ideology of the perceiver's adversaries. To the extent that partisans assumed disagreement concerning personally important values, they were also inaccurate in perceiving their adversaries' actual opinions. Discussion focuses on the cognitive mechanisms underlying misperceptions of disagreement and strategies for reducing intergroup conflict.

In addition to a periodic interest in fostering the immigration of co-religionists as a result of anti-Semitic movements, Jews have an interest in opposing the establishment of ethnically and culturally homogeneous societies in which they reside as minorities. Jews have been at the forefront in supporting movements aimed at altering the ethnic status quo in the United States in favor of immigration of non-European peoples. These activities have involved leadership in Congress, organizing and funding anti-restrictionist groups composed of Jews and gentiles, and originating intellectual movements opposed to evolutionary and biological perspectives in the social sciences.

Ince (1882-1924) was a popular motion-picture producer and director in the 1910s. He built his reputation and fortune by making feature films that appealed to middleclass tastes. In addition to his westerns and the epics for which he is best known, Ince made a number of social-problem films. Three of his films—The Italian (1914), Dangerous Hours (1920), and The Dark Mirror (1920)—are particularly interesting for how they illuminate the relationship between the American cinema and Progressive Era reform. A close analysis of these three films suggests ways that popular culture reflected the concerns of mainstream progressives and how these concerns shifted during the course of the decade.

My focus on Livesay's lyric poetry aims to productively link female subjectivity to a belated Canadian modernism which included female poets writing about themselves, their own gender and their belonging to Canada. Livesay's early work is focused not on the objectivity idealized by "post-Eliot" male modernists such as A.J.M. Smith, but on the subjectivity of an emerging female-centred poetics found in the work of Virginia Woolf, Katherine Mansfield, H.D., Edith Sitwell, and Amy Lowell. Inspired by feminist readings of Modernism, in this essay I am interested in reevaluating Livesay's "native" poetry in opposition to a male "cosmopolitan" Canadian modernism. The combination of her very long and accomplished literary career, her commitment to left-wing politics as well as her lifelong commitment to Canadian literature make her a crucial figure for the understanding and rereading of Canadian modernism.

Precisely this enchantment led her to see clearly the deep vices of Soviet Russia, when so many on the sane and sober Left were blind to them. So pedestrian liberals ought to relish having the extreme likes of Goldman in their midst. They-we-can faithfully recite their lessons from Mill about free speech, eccentrics, and the proliferation of viewpoints. But more recent liberals and deliberative democrats, insisting on the political centrality of reasonableness, would have problems embracing her. That should give us pause at the politics of reasonableness. And Goldman's infatuation with her own politics offers a tweak on Aristotle: a bad person can make a good citizen.

An examination of the tension between the highly protective approach to advocacy of crime taken by the Supreme Court in Brandenburg v. Ohio and the provisions in many criminal codes that make those who encourage criminal violations generally punishable for solicitation is followed by an analysis of the penological reasons for punishing crime-causing communications and of the relevance to such communications of the justifications for freedom of expression. After an account of the Supreme Court decisions dealing with this subject and a summary critical examination of interpretive approaches to the First Amendment, the author suggests standards for constitutional appraisal of prohibitions of communications that may cause crime. The central proposals are that most statements of fact and value be accorded virtually absolute protection; that dominantly situation-altering utterances, such as agreements, offers of agreement, and orders, be treated as outside the scope of First Amendment protection; and that simple encouragements to commit specific crimes, a kind of action-inducing communication, be granted a degree of protection that depends heavily on context, with criteria like those contained in Brandenburg applicable to public ideological solicitation but with much less restrictive standards applicable to private solicitation.

Critical to this endeavour has been an engagement directly with the theories and philosophies of key activists and scholars, such as W. E. B. DuBois and Richard Wright. Contributing to this effort, I provide a study of Malcolm X. As an activist and outspoken member of the African American Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s and 1960s, Malcolm X re-articulated Black radical thought in significant ways. In particular, Malcolm X placed a territorial dimension at the heart of the Civil Rights Movement and in so doing re-conceptualized the theoretical and practical linkages between the African American movement and other 'Third World' movements. The immediate purpose of this paper therefore is to delineate the territorial dimensions of the revolutionary thought of Malcolm X. Heuristically, this paper is situated within four broad areas of inquiry: revolutions and social movements; the thinking of space; anti-racist geographies; and the imbrication of gender and revolutionary thought. More broadly, however, this paper reiterates the call for a more sustained engagement by geographers on the theories and philosophies of Black radical intellectuals.

Weiss	Journal of Peace Research	12	1	1975-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-17	Sage Publications, Ltd.	fla		This essay reflects the fact that under the pressure to think about global crises and problems, too little consideration has been given to the costs and benefits of various global measures in terms of individual and local autonomy. The central hypothesis is that the tradition of philosophical anarchism provides peace researchers scrutinizing global problems with a crucial yet often-ignored perspective. This essay introduces the literature of philosophical anarchism and suggests how it is heuristically useful in global value clarification, and also for formulating action strategies.

Sometimes political trials result. This paper draws upon several such trials to analyze the goals and behavior of their participants, especially the defense. Often political defendants and their lawyers wish, for several reasons, to introduce ideological issues into the proceedings, creating a degree of conflict lacking in most ordinary criminal cases. As part of this strategy, many political defendants refuse to play the passive role expected of them in court. Those who act as their own attorneys may uniquely advance the goals of a political-legal defense. Ignorant of judicial procedure, their ability to depart from courtroom norms by speaking to political and moral issues is typically greater than that of most attorneys, who are bound by their obligations as officers of the court. The increased participation of these defendants in all aspects of the trial may also help to win sympathy from the jury.

In response, Fasu males have tightened the boundaries of their agnatic descent groups to become exclusive patriunits. Cash royalties are incorporated into sociopolitical exchange, so the formation of exclusive kin groups allows males to expand social networks to other regions, whilst ensuring continuing wealth for future generations. Consequently, males are becoming isolated from pre-oil exchange networks, and females are becoming isolated within villages. In this article, I map the transition of Fasu kin networks from an ideology of descent to a dogma of descent and patrilineal solidarity, locating the transition in the symbolic codes that inform kin categories. I aim to highlight some consequences of "development" and to advance knowledge on the link between kinship and descent in a postcolonial, industry-dominated Papua New Guinea.

Norwood	Journal of Social History	28	2	1994-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 331-349	Oxford University Press	fla		During the first quarter of the twentieth century, male college students represented a major, and often critically important source of strikebreakers. While administrators frowned on many student extra-curricular activities, they strongly encouraged strikebreaking. Students enthusiastically embraced strikebreaking not just to display antagonism toward labor, but even more importantly to prove their manhood. Strikebreaking provided the collegian with his best opportunity, short of military combat, to test his strength and nerve. It exposed him to danger and provided an opportunity to fight. The early twentieth century "crisis of masculinity" in the upper and middle classes was manifested in men's repeated efforts to demonstrate their virility. Most men were involved in violent sports only vicariously, as spectators, but strikebreaking permitted direct participation in "daring deeds." Engineering students were also drawn into strikebreaking by their profession's new antipathy toward labor. Management coveted their services because they often represented the only available pool of skilled labor.

Nor have scholars recognized the extent of the differences between the two printed versions of the speech, one in the July 1917 issue of Goldman's magazine Mother Earth, the other in an October 1917 pamphlet. This essay argues that the two versions of Goldman s address are best seen not as slightly modified representations of the same speech, but as different, albeit consanguineous, rhetorical acts with their own audiences and purposes.

Committed to the Social Gospel's preaching of social salvation, they insisted that only an end to capitalism would usher in the Kingdom of God on earth. For many party members, socialism was at once the true meaning of Jesus's teaching and the basis of an emerging universal religion that would supersede conventional Christianity. These arguments, which were less readily expressed by theologians who identified with denominations, seminaries, and the Federal Council of Churches, reflected the special institutional milieu of the party. Party identification liberated its members from exclusive dependence on church structures and allowed them to develop profoundly nonecclesial theologies.

The investigation of how a poor people's revolt was signified in the landscape is situated at the intersection of social theories dealing with discourse, regulation, iconology, landscape, and semiotics. Using "discursive regulation" and "regional discursive formation" as diagnostic devices, the paper analyzes two traditions present in the Shays memorial: regionalist, ethnocentric, and patriotic ideologies of the New England Societies who erected the memorial; and the modern discourses of Unitarian conscience, theistic evolutionism, and Progressivism prevalent among the professional elite of Petersham who welcomed the memorial. The two discourses are theorized as parts of a single discursive formation, a conservative system representing the regional power hegemony of the New England elite in the pre-Fordist United States. Deconstructing the Petersham memorial adds to critical cultural geography the notion that landscapes are the spatial surfaces of regulatory regimes, intended to frame social imaginaries, often in definite, system-supportive ways.

The voices of battered women can disrupt that dominant construction of the space of the home, a construction typified by the work of Gaston Bachelard. The space that Bachelard presupposes and theorizes as given is in fact being-produced, cleaned, and organized by people who themselves may not find in it any solace or respite.

Myriam Schach's career is a striking case in point. Her singular career in the Jewish nationalist movement notwithstanding, she has been deemed worthy of no more than a few passing remarks in works on Zionism. She is likewise all but absent from gender history, despite her lifelong commitment to gaining proper recognition for women's role in society. The reason is that Schach did not conform to any of the stereotypes of her day, even if she is a figure who sheds light on the career of many other Jewish women who were her contemporaries.

Geller	Annual Review of Anthropology	38		2009-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 65-81	Annual Reviews	fla		From its inception, the archaeology of gender was entwined with feminism. Engagement has engendered reconstructions of complex, diverse peoples and practices that are more equitable, relevant, and sound. Yet, for many archaeologists, the connection with feminist perspectives has frayed in recent years. Their studies of gender articulate dated ideas about women and epistemological frames that highlight duality and universality. Examinations of labor divisions typify shortcomings. To advance gender's study and archaeology, practitioners need to consider several concerns about identity and difference emerging from thirdwave feminism. Gender is envisioned as intersection. Bioarchaeology, especially, will benefit from feminist approaches that reflect critically and regard gender in nonnormative and multiscalar terms. To this end, resistance to feminism must fade. Opposition stems from its imagined relationship with postmodernism, but conflation misconstrues feminism's sociopolitical commitment to emancipatory change. For their part, archaeologists can utilize feminist perspectives to diversify the field, explore difference, and tackle archaeological issues with sociopolitical resonance.

As McKinley clung to life for several days before succumbing, praise was heaped upon James B. "Big Jim" Parker, an African American Exposition employee who was credited with saving McKinley's life by subduing and disarming Czolgosz. By the time of Czolgosz's execution, government officials and the mainstream press were characterizing Parker as a glory-seeker who had played no role in capturing Czolgosz. African American spokespersons vigorously defended Parker, contrasting the brave, patriotic black hero with the treacherous foreign radical whose murderous act struck symbolically at the heart of the nation. These black commentators constructed a framework for understanding the assassination as a cultural critique of an American society that was paying the price for its acquiescence to extralegal violence against blacks. At the same time, black spokespersons used the assassination to create a narrative in support of African Americans' claims to American citizenship and national belonging.

It provides the background and context for the Commission's endorsement of this statement and lists the elements adopted. In each of the areas defined, the article reviews and assesses NHPRC-supported efforts and reflects selectively on the progress made by the archival profession in the United States. Finally, noting the NHPRC's role as a collaborative mechanism, the article concludes that the concept of a national records program has continued relevance, if the archival profession and its partners can define and work together on three or four focused goals.

Hunt	The Review of Politics	64	1	2002-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 81-119	Cambridge University Press, University of Notre Dame du lac on behalf of Review of Politics	fla		Twentieth-century feminist scholarship has largely ignored the foundational role of theology in Wollstonecraft's moral and political philosophy, and its role in shaping the development of her philosophy of the family through three distinct stages. Wollstonecraft was a traditional trinitarian Anglican in her early writings, a rationalistic unitarian Christian Dissenter in her middle writings, and a Romantic deist, skeptic and possible atheist in her late writings. The early Wollstonecraft views the traditional family as a cave that traps humanity in a morass of corruption with no hope of escape except in the next life; the middle Wollstonecraft believes that once the family takes a new, egalitarian form, it can serve as a "little platoon" (to use Burke's phrase) that instills the moral, social and political virtues in each generation of citizens; while the late Wollstonecraft fears that the traditional family is a prison from which women have little hope of escape, either in this world or through passage to the next.

A subject of particularly intense scrutiny and action is the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). This narrative, intended to provide an inside perspective on the reported results of the firm, is particularly important when attempting to evaluate the investment prospects of the marginal or poorly performing firm. However, managers may restrict the information content of the disclosure, raising potential concerns about ethical behavior. In this study, we employ a proprietary instrument to measure the quality of MD&A disclosures for a sample of firms entering financial distress. We evaluate the disclosure behavior of these firms in an effort to determine whether changes in the disclosure appear to be motivated primarily by economic or ethical concerns. We find, on average, that firms increase disclosure quality in the year of initial distress. However, sustained increases in disclosure quality are limited to firms that subsequently recover from the distress. The results suggest that observed changes in disclosure are driven primarily by economic considerations, rather than ethical ones, especially in good economic times.

Morton	Social Service Review	62	1	1988-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 61-82	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Historians of social policy have emphasized its twentieth-century modernization: the substitution of a secular for a religious outlook, of trained professionals for "friendly visitors," of organized, efficient delivery of services for well-intentioned but unsystematic philanthropy. However, an examination of the changing relationship between a federated charity organization that self-consciously embodied these modern trends and member maternity homes that resisted them raises questions about this analysis. Although conclusions from a case study should be tentative, these suggest that generalizations, first, about the ability of federated charities to shape social policy and, second, about the decline of the religious impulse in social services should be made with equal caution.

Moya	Jewish History	18	1	2004-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 19-48	Springer	fla		During the late 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, anarchism represented the most important faction of the radical left in the Atlantic world. This movement attracted a disproportionately high number of Jews. During the same period Buenos Aires became both an important magnet for Jewish immigration and one of the main centers of anarchist activism in the world. This article shows how the Jewish presence in the anarchist movement of the city became, in an amazingly short time and almost ex nihilo, so visible that it turned into a stereotype. The article then attempts to provide an explanation for this phenomenon that relies on a sociological and comparative perspective and questions notions of Jewish exceptionalism and arguments based on the eschatology and ethics of Judaism. Finally, it explores how stereotypes that function at one level as signifiers of alterity and mechanisms of exclusion, can, at another social level, promote acceptance and check anti-Semitism.

Analysis of the subject and style of these cartoons suggest that the signature on them was an anagrammatic pseudonym for painter John Sloan, a leading figure of the Ash Can School and later art director for the Masses. Sloan confirms this in his diary, which provides the reader with evidence of the painter's inclination to use anagrams and fictitious names. The cartoons document a forgotten aspect of the artist's career and reveal many of his political and aesthetic influences. The images also explicate Sloan's personal political commitments and the origins of his later unique imagery. This essay examines Sloan's early cartoons, while questioning why Sloan would choose to hide his identity when creating images for the New York Call.

Observing that problematic assumptions about ethnic identity and women's sexual and political agency emerged in the debates and ultimately wove their way into the ICTY's legal treatment of rape, the article argues that the international criminalization of rape might be neither as pathbreaking nor as progressive as the doctrinal recognition might suggest.

The insistence of feminist biographers that the personal is political, and that attention must be paid to the daily lives of their subjects as well as to their more public achievements, continues to ripple through the field of biography as a whole. To talk about biography is also to talk about the biographer, for the precise reason that behind every biography lies autobiography—that special spark that draws the biographer to the subject in the first place and the interaction that unfolds as the project moves forward (or stalls, as often happens). As feminist theory reminds us, the personal element is relevant to the broader intellectual agenda.

But what happens to the cultural tradition when the prophecy of doom comes to be experienced as reality, and predictions give way to reaction? How did the discourse of the end of Petersburg change when the legendary curse of Peter's estranged wife-"This city will be empty"-turned into the devastation of postrevolutionary Petrograd: violent, starved, frozen, and diseased? In this article Polina Barskova explores various cultural expressions of the urban crisis in the years just after 1917. These artistic reactions come from Viktor Shklovskii, Pavel Shillingovskii, Semen Pavlov, and Grigorii Kozintsev, among others. Here, the focus is on the tension between two impulses: to distance and aestheticize the ruins or to bring them closer to author and recipient, rendering these signs of urban disaster maximally incoherent and ugly. The article argues that the Petersburg authors use both strategies, as well as their hybrids.

Bachin	Journal of Social History	36	4	2003-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 941-962	Oxford University Press	fla		This article analyzes the 1919 baseball scandal in relation to broader issues including labor, "outsiders," and Americanism following World War I. I argue that the scandal muted concerns about labor relations raised by players, and instead focused on supposed threats by "outsiders" and "foreigners" who, through their connections to the sporting underworld, sullied the American institution of baseball. I juxtapose the Black Sox scandal with the nationwide steel strike of 1919 to highlight how the rhetoric used to discuss both events, by industrial leaders, social commentators, and the popular press, reflected rising nativist attitudes and ideas that ultimately fueled the Red Scare and the Palmer Raids. Discussions of both the steel strike and the Black Sox scandal were subsumed under the banner of Americanism, and illustrated how the meaning of Americanism was constricted following the war. Sites such as the shopfloor and the baseball field became arenas in which these narrowing definitions of Americanism were constructed and negotiated.

The Constitution of India might have been there for four and a half decades, a dense thicket of formal procedures might still feature the daily schedule of administration, a prime minister might trot the globe, a president might end his tenure and be succeeded by a new one; the Union of India is nonetheless now all things to all men. Jacques Derrida and his arcane theory of 'de-construction' are thus having their vindication in an altogether strange context.

I argue that these provide necessary directives and contexts for ecofeminist analyses and social/ecological projects. In the past these have been very diverse and occasionally contradictory. Most important to the core of ecofeminism's vitality are close links between theory and political activism. I show how these originated in ecofeminism's history and advocate a continued participatory and activist focus in the future.

Doctorow's Ragtime depicts crucial events in the life of Coalhouse Walker which are prefigured in Kleist's Michael Kohlhaas. The willful violation of the hero's property initiates grievous wrongs and leads him to a monomaniacal pursuit of justice that is constantly obstructed by corruption. During his struggle the crusader's companion sacrifices her life; he experiences a fateful encounter with the leader of his faith, and finally meets a violent death that might be viewed as suicide. Contextually interpreted, Coalhouse Walker and Booker T. Washington appear to be reincarnations of Kohlhaas and Luther, and the events of the novel that parallel occurrences in the 16th century constitute a universal pattern of order (or disorder) whose repetition characterizes "the activity of this planet." Doctorow's use of Kleist's novella, like the model itself, is an artistic adaptation of literary materials that through meaningful differences from the older version adds a significant level of relevance to the modern transformation of the tale.

If we submit the play to a 'second reading', however, it becomes clear that the ethical intricacies of whistle-blowing are interwoven with epistemological issues. Basically, the play is about the complex task of communicating scientific (notably microbiological) data to lay audiences. This becomes even more apparent when we realise that Stockmann was a contemporary of real 'microbe hunters' such as Pasteur and Koch. The play's basic message is that epoch-making scientists (such as Pasteur and Koch) not only produced convincing and reliable data from a scientific point of view, but also acquired the skills and insights needed to enter into a dialogue with their cultural and societal environment.

La nature de la crise en tant que phénomène historique a changé au cours du XIXe siècle et c'est sa récurrence qui conduit à l'idée de révolution. En effet les crises cycliques liées aux mutations économiques ont été si régulières qu'un changement révolutionnaire est devenu envisageable pour un nombre croissant de personnes. Les débats idéologiques du XXe siècle ont été conditionnés par ces considérations et la persistance des crises rend l'idée de révolution toujours actuelle.

It is the organizational basis of most major institutions, including the division of labor in the home, the workforce, politics, and religion. Globally, women's gendered roles are regarded as subordinate to men's. The gender divide enforces women's roles in reproduction and support activities and limits their autonomy, it limits their participation in decision making and highly-rewarded roles, and it puts women at risk. Social, cultural, and psychological mechanisms support the process. Differentiation varies with the stability of groups and the success of social movements. Gender analyses tend to be ghettoized; so it is recommended that all sociologists consider gender issues in their studies to better understand the major institutions and social relationships in society.

Doctorow is difficult to place on the map of postmodernism because he is equally concerned with narrative or representational technique and with issues of history, power, and identity. Doctorow has focused his concerns in the question of technology, representing in each of his major works technological principles that not only typify the historical epoch in which the novel is set but also characterize the representational mode of the novel itself. The differences among technologies in his novels produce an arc of development that moves from a critique of the coercive power of a system epitomized by the electrical circuit in The Book of Daniel to a celebration of the possibilities for imaginative and representational freedom created by the computer in Loon Lake. Concentrating on the technology of narrative, Doctorow has contributed striking redefinitions of the historical subject while testing and extending the resources of the contemporary novel.

Their theories used theoretical mechanisms based on adaptation and complementarity. They envisioned prehistoric women as born superior or equal to men. Eventually, however, women were made biologically inferior by adapting to circumstances created by their passive nature or man's greater passion. Ward's and Thomas' perspectives are identified as corporate liberal and technocratic. In addition to discussing their theories on marriage and the family, Ward's and Thomas' programmatic statements are compared with those of J. S. Mill, the socialists and contemporary women's rights movements.

Oppressive and restrictive social systems drive those excluded to claim "there must be something better than this. " While many women have engaged in Utopian flights of fancy, fewer have had the opportunity to bring their vision into being. Jane Addams and Dorothy Day are two women who imagined the possibility of a different world and each initiated influential movements to make their dreams a reality. Both created communities devoted to social service, worked among the oppressed, had radical ideas about social morality, and both were staunch pacifists. These two pioneering women also represent a stark contrast in Utopian thinking. One was a pragmatist feminist who fought for women's suffrage becoming a political force to be reckoned with. The other was a Catholic anarchist who eschewed the right to vote and refused to participate in politics. This article seeks to bring attention to the intriguing continuities and discontinuities of the activist philosophies of Jane Addams and Dorothy Day. While both Utopian visions have their appeal, I suggest that ultimately Day's approach is one of charity and Addams's is one of education, and that the latter holds the most promise for feminist activist theorizing.

This article explores the organization's founding, programs, and the variety of motives that led individuals to participate in lacw's causes. By linking the struggle against war with the struggle against poverty, and by relying on self-sacrifice as a primary strategy, this peace group remained viable while providing essential services to the poor, expanding its ideological focus and effectiveness, and shaping America's consciousness and conscience.

Focusing on the writings of D. T. Suzuki, Alan Watts, Gary Snyder, and Philip Whalen, it shows how Beat Zen emerged not primarily from an Orientalist appropriation of "the East" but rather from an Occidentalist, Japanese-centered criticism of American materialism that followed from the complex legacy of the World's Parliament of Religions at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. In staking their claims to Zen, in other words, Philip Whalen and Gary Snyder—the Beat poets on whom this essay focuses—along with Alan Watts expressed the views not of cultural imperialists, as one might suppose, but of converts to what they regarded as a superior way of life.   The Beat adoption of Zen intersected with a broadly libertarian and specifically anarchist social milieu in San Francisco that congregated around Kenneth Roxroth's Libertarian Club and Anarchist Circle. The individualist, anti-statist, and anarchist political outlooks of Beat Zen anarchists were directly confirmed by the writings of D. T. Suzuki, who presented Zen as a practice of personal liberation from cultural conditioning. Suzuki's rhetorical approach—which treated Japanese Zen as both a pinnacle of Asian civilization and a key to the liberation of Western humanity from its stifling and destructive rationalism—was informed by Meiji-era Japanese nationalism and exceptionalism and by the universalism that Buddhist missionaries brought to their explanations of Zen to Westerners. Arguing that Beat Zen poets, in adopting Buddhism as it was presented to them, were foremost Occidentalist rather than Orientalist in outlook, this essay concludes that the Beat Zen anarchist cultural formation suggests a libertarian alternative to Orientalism and also reconfigures common conceptions of American radical literary history as primarily Marxist-inflected.

It traces the social and cultural origins of Frank's career before exploring the various femininities through which she was constructed. Frank is read against other public Jewish women—Jewish actresses Sarah Bernhardt and Adah Menken, as well as Emma Goldman and Emma Lazarus—in order to uncover and interpret the common cultural spectrum on which public Jewish women have been understood. Interpreted as a true woman, a beautiful Jewess and a universalistic preacher, Frank was inserted into existing cultural tropes that made hers a comforting and legible example amidst the era's destabilizing mass of Jewish immigrants.

It tries to accommodate this disparate evidence within a single two-period, expected utility model of a martyrdom contract, to which volunteers sign up in the expectation of probabilistic earthly rewards. Contract enforcement is ensured by a sufficiently strong stigma, or social sanction, placed on renegades. The main implication for counterterrorism policy is that the sanction should be softened, so as to turn prospective martyrs into apostates.

Public health was then seen as compatible with the ideology of womanhood, a legitimate way for middle-class women to participate in public life. Women physicians, nurses, and scientists were prominent in the early public health movement, in such areas as maternal and child health, statistics, bacteriology, and occupational health. This paper highlights the contributions of some of the women involved in public health research and practice. It concludes by noting that the motivations of many women students in schools of public health today are similar to those expressed by the social reformers and scientists of the progressive era.

Fight Club is a significant marker in the development of a utopianism that is dynamic and adaptive, existing in the present of history rather than in a vacuum of idealism. Building on theories of revolution proffered by Slavoj Žižek and Frederic Jameson, I argue that within the novel the body becomes a potential site for exploring difference and creates both an alternative to and a critique of the distorted narrative of dominant society. Bodies that are marked, wounded, scarred, and beaten are bodies in the process of exploring alternatives to an oppressive social world where “completeness” trumps difference. Fight club allows men to fiercely embody revolution and desire and rejuvenate utopia with every punch. I distinguish between the dynamic and subversive nature of fight club and the militaristic and fascist system of Project Mayhem, which displays the values of traditional utopian thinking and as such fails to maintain the liberating and transgressive qualities of fight club.

In the first part of the twentieth century, musicals viewed life through rose-colored glasses; musicals were equivalent to musical comedy. Starting in the 1940s, the mood of musicals darkened. One indication of the new, serious tone was that characters in musicals died in the course of the show. This essay examines several questions relating to death in the Broadway musical, such as who dies, when in the course of the drama the death occurs, and how the death is marked musically. It concludes with a look at musicals involving the deaths of historical characters and at AIDS-related musicals, works whose assumptions and ideals are very far from those of the musical comedies of the early twentieth century.

The prevailing discourses constituted Goldman as violent, utilizing her alleged menace to distract attention from far more egregious violence against labor by state and corporate forces. Goldman responded by denying, confronting, and redirecting the alarmed gaze toward greater risks left underarticulated in hegemonic accounts. Goldman's bold confrontations with authorities constituted a kind of anarchist parrhesia, fearless speech, a relentless truth-telling practice that risked her own security in pursuit of her "beautiful ideal." The labor of remembering America's history of class violence hones our attention to the complex discursive processes by which some historical facts come to count in prevailing narratives, while others fade into obscurity.

This paper places the suppression of anarchists and the exclusion and deportation of foreigners in the aftermath of the “shot that shocked the world” within the context of international anti-anarchist efforts, and reveals that President McKinley's assassination successfully pulled the United States into an existing global conversation over how to combat anarchist violence. This paper argues that these anti-anarchist restrictions and the suppression of expression led to the emergence of a “free speech consciousness” among anarchists, and others, and to the formation of the Free Speech League, predecessor of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Challenging governmental suppression transformed anarchists' identities from violent criminals to free speech defenders. This paper also explores the history, passage, and implementation of the Alien Immigration Act of 1903, which barred and expelled anarchists, those associated with anarchists, and those advocating anarchism, and became the first federal law authorizing the exclusion or deportation of foreigners based on their ideological beliefs, associations, and/or expressions. In United States ex rel. Turner v. Williams (1904), the Supreme Court affirmed the deportation of British philosophical anarchist John Turner and upheld the Alien Act's constitutionality, establishing the precedent for future ideological restrictions of foreigners. This legal precedent paved the way for the mass deportations of radicals after the 1919 Palmer Raids, the exclusion of alleged communist writers, actors, and professors under the McCarran Act of 1950 and the McCarran-Walter Act of 1952, and eventually for a visa denial barring entry to an Islamic scholar under the Patriot Act of 2001.

Southworth's originally massively popular novel, The Hidden Hand (1859), was not published as a book until it had undergone serialization three separate times, over the course of a quarter century, in a weekly story-paper called the New York Ledger. This bare fact about the material form in which it circulated and gained its large and admiring audience has consequences for interpreting the novel that have gone entirely unexamined by scholars. Thus, Southworth's novel offers a good test case for the claim that the material form of publication (in this case, periodical serialization) is a substantively important aspect of the work's meaning: the readers who responded to it so enthusiastically had all read it under the conditions of seriality. In this essay I attempt to take account of the interpretive implications of seriality for understanding Southworth's novel, exploring some of the ways in which it was ideologically embedded in the Ledger and describing the active and canny role it played in that periodical's strident apoliticism. The Hidden Hand embodied the magazine's declared nonpartisanship in, among other things, various forms of generic melding and imaginary scenarios of sectional uni�cation. Critical accounts that have sought to characterize this novel as proslavery or antislavery have all missed the point that Southworth's tale actively ignored such political issues and thus sought to transcend the dire sectional controversies that were unmistakably impending at the time of its publication.

I examine the idea of the 'genius' and the 'superman' in order to shed light on why, for some Edwardian feminists, the ideal feminist agent was to be an elite, discerning, remote figure. I argue that Edwardian feminism witnessed an 'introspective turn', marked by an interest in character, will, and personality as the key components of emancipation. The focus of political change was firmly located within women themselves. This belief was widespread, even though only a minority chose the language of the 'superwoman' to elaborate it. References to the 'superwoman' indicates the impact of Nietzschean and egoist ideas upon the women's movement. The 'superwoman' was used to position feminism as a movement not just for political rights but for wider social regeneration, and represents a characteristically Edwardian belief in the power of the 'exceptional individual' to promote social change.

While most socialist policy makers viewed party music as escapist, a form of "ideological diversionism" and false consciousness, they also recognized that Cubans loved dance bands and that restrictive policies could potentially foster a negative or puritanical image of the new state. Analysis suggests that tepid official support for this repertoire led to a drastic reduction in dance music activity, a trend offset only by the gradual emergence of new forms of composition such as nueva trova and the broader dissemination and performance of classical and folkloric arts. The contrast between Cuban dance music and forms that would later evolve in New York is also highlighted. Cet article retrace l'histoire et le rôle de la musique de danse au sein de la société cubaine, avant et après la Révolution. Si la plupart des décideurs de politique socialistes considéraient la musique de danse comme une forme d'évasion, de diversion « idéologique et d'égarement de conscience », ils n'ignoraient pas le culte voué par les Cubains aux orchestres de danse et qu'une politique restrictive en la matière risquait de donner au nouvel État une image puritaine ou négative. L'analyse semble indiquer que la tiédeur de la politique officielle envers ce genre musical se traduisit par une forte perte d'influence de la musique de danse, tendance qui fut uniquement compensée par l'apparition progressive de nouvelles formes de composition, telles que la nueva trova, et par une plus vaste diffusion et de plus nombreuses auditions d'oeuvres classiques et folkloriques. Cette étude propose également une analyse des différences entre la musique de danse cubaine et les formes qui devaient apparaîitre plus tard à New York.

Il propose à la fois un survol historiographique et une étude de cas portant sur la participation rituelle de membres de la classe ouvrière à des meetings politiques en plein air, en gros de 1900 à 1930, comme manifestation d'une culture vivante liant travail, luttes et loisirs. L'histoire orale est en outre considérée comme un moyen actuel de revivifier la culture ouvrière, quand elle est pratiquée, comme c'est le cas depuis le début des années 1980, par des travailleurs ordinaires, des syndicats, des artistes et des historiens dans le cadre de programmes gouvernementaux pour introduire l'art sur les lieux de travail. /// This article examines the way that oral history has extended the boundaries of traditional labour historiography to include social and cultural aspects of working-class life. It presents both a historiographical survey and a case-study of the ritual attendance at out-door political meetings by working-class people between roughly 1900 and 1930, as a manifestation of a vibrant culture which linked work with struggle and leisure. In addition, I consider the use of oral history as a tool for revitalising present-day labour culture, when under-taken since the early 1980s by rank-and-file workers, trade unions, artists and historians as part of workplace art strategies funded by various state agencies.

But as a young man he had made a name for himself as a notorious labor agitator, and he went on to publish two books on the US labor movement, which are worthy of reconsideration as important interpretations of independent trade unionism and political reform. The first volume appeared in 1921 and offered an original perspective on the popular syndicalism that formed such a large, positive element of the philosophy of the International Workers of the World (IWW), to the extent it had one, at the center of which lay the struggle for social recognition on the part of immigrant and (supposedly) unskilled workers. The second appeared thirty years later and provided a thoughtful defense of the private, employment-based welfare and industrial relations system that the New Deal established in the United States. Together the books offer a provocative account of the social and individual radicalism of US-style "pure and simple" trade unionism.
